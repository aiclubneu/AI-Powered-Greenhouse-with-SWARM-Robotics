# AI-Powered-Greenhouse-with-SWARM-Robotics

THE PROBLEM:

More than 29% of the world is suffering from food scarcity, and with climate change and global warming getting worse over the years, the problem is not getting any better.

Farmers now have to find alternatives to regular farming as a result of global warming, which is why greenhouse farming has grown so quickly over the last few years. However, greenhouse farming is, 
less productive 
more expensive 
higher risk
less diverse
limited on scalability 

All these issues make greenhouse farming less appealing and therefore, doesn't really help in mitigating global hunger.



OUR SOLUTION:

Creating an AI-Powered Greenhouse With SWARM Robotics 

1.) Using SWARM Robots to
perform tasks like planting and harvesting
record data using sensors
monitor environment 24/7

2.) Using AI to
Analyze Environmental Data
Make Adjustments
Make Decisions related to Pest Control, Diseases, and Crop Yield

3.) Benefits
Increased Efficiency
Greater Output 
Sustainable 



HOW WILL IT WORK?:

-Monitor Crop Health: Use of camera/color sensor to recognize healthy and unhealthy plants.

-Recognize Specific Plants:  Be able to recognize each plant and make unique decisions.

-Moisture Level: Check the Moisture Level of the Plants and decide whether they need water.

-Ready for Harvest: Observe crops and decide whether itâ€™s ready for harvest based on color, size, etc.

-Weed Recognition: Use predictive analysis and cameras to recognize, remove, and prevent weeds.
